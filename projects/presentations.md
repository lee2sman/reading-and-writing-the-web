# PRESENTATIONS

* So far in this course we have primarily been building websites. For this assignment students will explore and analyze key concepts and techniques powering the Web today. The exploration will be motivated by a more nuanced consideration of the webâ€™s function in society gained through readings and discussion. The goal is for each student to investigate a current topic of personal interest regarding internet and society. Students should research broadly, analyze this research, and synthesize their findings for presentation. Students should also be prepared to answer additional questions from their classmates during a Q&A.
