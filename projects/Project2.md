# Branching Narrative

Hypertext and hyperlinking are a fundamental feature of the modern web. We take for granted that using the net means surfing from webpage to webpage. Early web-based artists and creative practitioners experimented with this new medium, creating hyperlink media (hypermedia) and new forms of narrative storytelling.

For this project you will create a hyperlinked narrative project with HTML, CSS and Javascript. We will have a warm-up and several stages leading up to the completion of the project.

### Grading will be based on

* demonstrated understanding of the material
* conceptually creativity
* aesthetic quality
* technical skill

### Steps

1. Warm-up: Read [Power To The People: The Text Adventures of Twine](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/power-to-the-people-the-text-adventures-of-twine/1100-6402665/) or [Twine: The Videogame Technology For all](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/23/magazine/twine-the-video-game-technology-for-all.html). Play a Twine game or view an online branching narrative that we did not cover in class. Make a page linked off your class website. Include the title and creator. Describe the work. Include images if helpful. Write a short description of the work and then describe what you find compelling about the work (or what you think didn't work well).

2. Develop a concept that will guide the creation of your project. Are you telling a story? Is is straightforward, disjointed or abstract? How will you explain the concept and how will users know how to navigate?

3. Plan out the project with a sitemap and wireframing. What are the technical parts underlying your site? What styling will you use? What scripting will you need to include?

4. Build a draft version of your site. Make sure to do iterative testing as you build it to ensure its functionality. Do user testing and get feedback and make refinements.

# Requirements

# WARM-UP - due 3/5
* What is your Design Concept?
* Draw/sketch a simple sitemap (flowchart)
* Wireframe your landing page
* Landing page prototype ready for feedback
* 1 - 2 other working pages ready for feedback

# FINAL ASSIGNMENT - due 3/19
* The story or branching narrative should have a clear and compelling concept that fits this choice of medium
* A clear landing/start page
* Info/Help/About or other clear instructions. This can be on the home page or another separate page.
* Your site should have at least 12 pages and at least 3 *endings* (which can be broadly defined. They don't have to be a traditional ending)
* Code should work! All links should function. All CSS must be applied. Navigation should be clear.
* Media (images, sound, video) should be used when appropriate. 
* The design (fonts, color, placement, sizes, etc) should be compelling and fit the concept.
